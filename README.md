# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Notebooks

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Notebooks repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploring various aspects of NLP. These notebooks are designed to help researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts dive into the world of text data analysis using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- **Text Preprocessing:** Notebooks that demonstrate techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and more.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Notebooks that provide detailed exploratory analysis of text data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Notebooks that apply sentiment analysis techniques to understand the emotions and opinions expressed in text data.
- **Topic Modeling:** Notebooks that cover methods for extracting and understanding topics from large text corpora using algorithms like LDA and NMF.
- **Text Classification:** Notebooks that implement machine learning models for classifying text data into predefined categories.
- **Word Embeddings:** Notebooks that explore word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and transformers to capture semantic meaning from text.
- **Advanced NLP:** Notebooks that showcase advanced NLP techniques, including named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging, and sequence-to-sequence models.
- **Case Studies:** Real-world case studies that apply NLP techniques to solve specific problems and derive actionable insights from text data.
